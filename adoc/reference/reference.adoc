== Wallet

This section describes all actions related to wallets.

=== Link [.bb-connect]#connect#

This allows users to link his existing wallets with your application. The difference with <<manage-wallets, Manage wallets>>:

- A user can only link wallets, it is not possible to create or import a wallet
- A list of all wallets is returned for any chain (it is possible to filter this).

An example use case could be a portfolio app where a user wants to quickly link all his wallets to get an overview of his complete portfolio.


To link wallets, use the connect building block with:

.URL
https://connect-staging.arkane.network/wallets/link

.Data
_No data needed_

=== [[manage-wallets]] Manage wallets [.bb-connect]#connect#

As an application, it is possible to have a user manage his wallets for a specific chain. During this action, the user can link existing wallets or import a wallet.
When the user returns to the app, a wallet will be linked to your application for the given chain. When a user does not have any wallets yet, a user can indicate to create a new wallet.

To manage wallets, use the connect building block with:

.URL
https://connect-staging.arkane.network/wallets/manage


.Data parameters
|===
|Name |Description |Example

|chain
|The chain for which you want to manage wallets.
|ethereum

|===


.Data example
[source,json]
----
{
  "chain": "ethereum"
}
----

=== List user wallets [.bb-api]#api#
Returns all the wallets for the specified user (bearer token)

operation::get-wallets[snippets='curl-request,http-response,response-fields']

It's also possible to filter based on secret type

operation::get-wallets-filtered[snippets='request-parameters']


[[get-specific-user-wallet]]
=== Get specific user wallet [.bb-api]#api#
Returns the details for a specific wallet (native balance is also included)

operation::get-wallet[snippets='curl-request,path-parameters,http-response,response-fields']

=== Native balance [.bb-api]#api#
Returns the "native" balance for a wallet. This is the balance of the native token used by the chain. Ex. ETH for Ethereum.

operation::get-balance[snippets='curl-request,path-parameters,http-response,response-fields']

=== Token balances [.bb-api]#api#
Returns the balance of all tokens currently supported by Arkane. The list of supported tokens can be found on https://github.com/ArkaneNetwork/content-management/tree/master/tokens[Github].

operation::get-token-balances[snippets='curl-request,path-parameters,http-response,response-fields']

=== Specific token balance [.bb-api]#api#
Returns the token balance for a specified token (this can be any token).

operation::get-token-balance[snippets='curl-request,path-parameters,http-response,response-fields']

== Transactions

[[transfer]]
=== Transfer [.bb-api]#api#
This can be used to transfer (native) tokens from a wallet to another wallet. To start a transfer you need to:

. Build the transaction request
. Execute a <<native-transactions,native transaction>> with the transaction result from (1)

To build the transaction request:

operation::build-transaction-request[snippets='curl-request,request-fields,response-body']

[NOTE]
====
If you want to perform a token transfer, add the field "tokenAddress". For "native" transfers, simply omit the field "tokenAddress".
====

[IMPORTANT]
====
For the *value*, we expect the *"decimal value"*. If a token has 18 decimals and you want to transfer 1 of the specific token, provide the value 1. Arkane will translate this to the correct non decimal value being: 1 * 10e18.
Using this, you don't have to take the different number of decimals for different tokens into account.
