=== [[link-wallets]] Link wallets link:buildingblocks.html#_arkane_connect[[.bb-connect]#Arkane Connect#]

This allows users to link his existing wallets with your application. The difference with <<manage-wallets, Manage wallets>>:

- A user can only link wallets, it is not possible to create or import a wallet
- A list of all wallets is returned for any chain (it is possible to filter this).

An example use case could be a portfolio app where a user wants to quickly link all his wallets to get an overview of his complete portfolio.


To link wallets, use the connect building block with:

.URL
https://connect-staging.arkane.network/wallets/link

.Data
_No data needed_

=== [[manage-wallets]] Manage wallets link:buildingblocks.html#_arkane_connect[[.bb-connect]#Arkane Connect#]

As an application, it is possible to have a user manage his wallets for a specific chain. During this action, the user can link existing wallets or import a wallet.
When the user returns to the app, a wallet will be linked to your application for the given chain. When a user does not have any wallets yet, a user can indicate to create a new wallet.

To manage wallets, use the connect building block with:

.URL
https://connect-staging.arkane.network/wallets/manage


.Data parameters
|===
|Name |Description |Example
|chain
|The chain for which you want to manage wallets.
|ethereum
|===


.Data example
[source,json]
----
{
  "chain": "ethereum"
}

=== [[list-wallets]] List wallets link:buildingblocks.html#_arkane_api[[.bb-api]#Arkane API#]
Returns all the wallets for the specified user (bearer token)

operation::get-wallets[snippets='curl-request,http-response,response-fields']

It's also possible to filter based on secret type

operation::get-wallets-filtered[snippets='request-parameters']


[[get-specific-user-wallet]]
=== [[get-wallet]] Get wallet link:buildingblocks.html#_arkane_api[[.bb-api]#Arkane API#]
Returns the details for a specific wallet (native balance is also included)

operation::get-wallet[snippets='curl-request,path-parameters,http-response,response-fields']

=== [[get-balance]] Native balance link:buildingblocks.html#_arkane_api[[.bb-api]#Arkane API#]
Returns the "native" balance for a wallet. This is the balance of the native token used by the chain. Ex. ETH for Ethereum.

operation::get-balance[snippets='curl-request,path-parameters,http-response,response-fields']

=== [[get-token-balances]] Token balances link:buildingblocks.html#_arkane_api[[.bb-api]#Arkane API#]
Returns the balance of all tokens currently supported by Arkane. The list of supported tokens can be found on https://github.com/ArkaneNetwork/content-management/tree/master/tokens[Github].

operation::get-token-balances[snippets='curl-request,http-response,response-fields']

=== [[get-token-balance]] Specific token balance link:buildingblocks.html#_arkane_api[[.bb-api]#Arkane API#]
Returns the token balance for a specified token (this can be any token).

operation::get-token-balance[snippets='curl-request,path-parameters,http-response,response-fields']

== Application Wallet

Application wallets are a special type of hybrid wallets that are owned by the user but transactions are initiated by an application. Only
transactions coming from the original application are accepted. Consequently, a user cannot move digital assets out of the wallet
without the application's approval. +
On the other hand, a transaction for this wallet always needs to be signed off with the user's PIN. So the user keeps the right of actually executing a transaction at all times.

Limitations on the application wallets:

* The user cannot initiate a transaction from outside the original application
* The user cannot export the private key of the wallet
* The user cannot connect other 3rd party applications to this application wallet
* The application is able to remove the above-mentioned restrictions, transforming the
application wallet into a normal Arkane wallet (this process cannot be reverted)

image::img/appwallets.png[App wallets]

=== Authentication
To use the application wallet functionality, two separate client ID's will need to be created (see link:buildingblocks.html#_arkane_identity[[.bb-api]#Arkane Identity#]).

* One will be used to create the transaction (steps 2 and 4). It has a naming convention of `<clientId>_app`. This client will authenticate to Arkane using a combination of shared secret and a Bearer token. Because it uses a
shared secret, it needs to be used in a server to server communication channel (the secret may never be exposed to the outside world). How to use this client will be described bellow.
* The other is used to initiate the signing of a transaction by the user (steps 5, 6, 7, 8, 10). This is the same client used for all other Arkane actions and will authenticate to
Arkane using a users Bearer token.

==== [[clientId_app-client]] The `<clientId>_app`-client
As described above, to create a transaction you need to use a `<clientId>_app`-client. For this we use OpenId Connect's link:https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-4.4[Client Credentials Grant]

image::img/appclientauthentication.png[<clientId>_app flow]

Here we'll describe how to obtain a bearer token from our authentication server using your `<clientId>_app`-client:

.URL
https://login.arkane.network/auth/realms/Arkane/protocol/openid-connect/token

.Example Curl Request
[source,bash]
----
$ curl https://login.arkane.network/auth/realms/Arkane/protocol/openid-connect/token -i -X POST \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' \
    -d 'grant_type=client_credentials&client_id=Arketype_app&client_secret=02053a9d-8293-43c4-a201-f8669f1329af'
----
IMPORTANT: Do not forget to set the `Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded` header (and to make the request body application/x-www-form-urlencoded),
otherwise the request will fail

=== Create a transaction link:buildingblocks.html#_arkane_api[[.bb-api]#Arkane API#]
Creating a transaction is done by sending the transaction to Arkane API using the bearer token of your <<clientId_app-client, <clientId>_app-client>>. +
In this example we are doing a generic <<transfer, transfer>>, but you can submit any type of transaction described under <<transactions, Transactions>> as long as the provided
wallet ID is of an application wallet (this is the reason we haven't documented the other request parameters).

=== [[execute-app-wallet-transaction]] Execute a requested transaction link:buildingblocks.html#_arkane_connect[[.bb-connect]#Arkane Connect#]
Before the transaction will be pushed to the blockchain, it first needs to be approved by the user. This can be done using Arkane Connect.

.URL
https://connect-staging.arkane.network/transaction/execute/:transactionId

.[[execute-application-transaction]] Path Parameters
|===
| Parameter | Description
| `+transactionId+` | The transactionId of the requested transaction

=== [[delete-app-wallet-transaction]] Delete  a requested transaction link:buildingblocks.html#_arkane_api[[.bb-api]#Arkane API#]
You can delete a requested transaction by calling the transaction endpoint of the Arkane API with method `DELETE`. This can be done by both the user as the application.

.URL
https://api.arkane.network/api/transactions/:transactionId

.[[execute-application-transaction]] Path Parameters
|===
| Parameter | Description
| `+transactionId+` | The transactionId of the requested transaction
|===

operation::delete-transaction-request[snippets='curl-request']

=== [[update-wallet-type]] Migrate wallet to a user wallet link:buildingblocks.html#_arkane_api[[.bb-api]#Arkane API#]
From the moment the requirements of an application wallet are not applicable anymore, the type of the application wallet can be migrated to user wallet. As a result, the wallet
will behave the same way as other wallets the user has created manually in Arkane. The user will be able to perform any transaction using this wallet.

In the case for a user wallet, the type of the wallet needs to be updated to:
`THREEWAY_SHARED`

operation::update-wallet-type[snippets='http-request,path-parameters,http-response']

https://connect-staging.arkane.network/transaction/execute


.[[generic-transaction-request]] Data parameters
operation::build-transaction-request[snippets='request-fields']

.Data example
operation::build-transaction-request[snippets='request-body']

.Result parameters
|===
|Path|Type|Description

|`+transactionHash+`
|`+String+`
|The transaction hash

|===

.Result example
[source,json]
----
{
  "transactionHash" : "0x621f692e386a8bc0c53d36aa793864893106e10f54f63fa9c063e24ad975d907"
}
----

[NOTE]
====
If you want to perform a token transfer, add the field "tokenAddress". For "native" transfers, simply omit the field "tokenAddress".
====

[IMPORTANT]
====
For the *value*, we expect the *"decimal value"*. If a token has 18 decimals and you want to transfer 1 of the specific token, provide the value 1. Arkane will translate this to the correct non decimal value being: 1 * 10e18.
Using this, you don't have to take the different number of decimals for different tokens into account.
